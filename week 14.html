  <h1>Week 14 – Feature Lock & Final Polish</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>🎯 Goal</h2>
    <p>Finalize all core features (<strong>Feature Lock</strong>), clean and organize project portfolios, and refine product presentation for a professional audience. All significant changes must be completed this week.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Task 1: Final Feature Lock</h2>
    <ul class="focus-questions">
      <li><span class="highlight">Are all your MVP features working as intended?</span><br>
        ✅ Yes! Calendar, weather, news, period timer, and YouTube integration are all functioning. <br>
        ❌ The mirror reflection and case are not yet added, which I feel is unfortunate.</li>

      <li><span class="highlight">Have you added any high-impact stretch features from your Week 13 testing?</span><br>
        🚧 Not yet — this week will focus on polish and stability.</li>

      <li><span class="highlight">What will make your project feel complete and ready for real-world use?</span><br>
        ✔️ If it could run 24/7 without errors and be mountable on the wall.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Task 2: Portfolio Overhaul & Narrative Alignment</h2>
    <ul class="checklist">
      <li>🧼 Removed duplicate, unclear, and misdated updates.</li>
      <li>🧼 Consistent headers across all project logs: <em>MVP, Summary, Major Milestones, Screenshots/Demo, What I Learned, Next Steps</em>.</li>
      <li>🧼 Timeline emphasized to show growth from idea → execution.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p><strong>🎯 Who is this product for?</strong><br>
      People who use mirrors frequently — especially for makeup or fitness (e.g. flexing their muscles).</p>

    <p><strong>🛠 What problem does it solve?</strong><br>
      Solves multitasking inefficiency — allows viewing important info while using the mirror (e.g. makeup time).</p>

    <p><strong>💼 Why invest or use this?</strong><br>
      It enhances your lifestyle. Stay updated with the news and notifications while minimizing wasted time — it could genuinely save hours per week.</p>

    <p><strong>✅ Checkpoint (Thursday):</strong><br>
      ✅ Submit revised portfolio with:
      <ul>
        <li>✓ Clear project timeline</li>
        <li>✓ Screenshots/videos of major milestones</li>
        <li>✓ Final product description</li>
        <li>✓ Target audience explanation</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Task 3: Presentation Framing</h2>
    <p><strong>💡 3 Strongest Points:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>1. Multifunctional design (news, weather, period timer, calendar)</li>
      <li>2. Seamless YouTube and info integration while using the mirror</li>
      <li>3. Productivity boost during daily routines</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>🌟 What makes this unique or useful?</strong><br>
      Unlike smart displays or phones, this blends naturally with a mirror, offering real-time info without pulling you out of your flow. It's not just functional — it's invisible until needed.</p>

    <p><strong>🎯 How will you grab attention from industry folks?</strong><br>
      Showcase real user scenarios (morning routines, gym mirrors), bold UI, and talk numbers: time saved = value added.</p>

    <p><strong>📋 Instructor Mini-Conference Topics:</strong><br>
      ✅ What's been done since MVP<br>
      ✅ Barriers (mirror/case hardware)<br>
      ✅ Next steps: UI polish, mountable case, video walkthrough</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>🧩 Looking Ahead: Week 15</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>🎤 Final presentation & pitch polish</li>
      <li>📹 Rehearse + gather feedback</li>
      <li>🎁 Deliverable should be job/internship ready</li>
      <li>📈 Focus: growth, polish, storytelling over complexity</li>
    </ul>
