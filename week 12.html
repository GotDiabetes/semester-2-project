  <h1>🗓️ Week 12 - Post-MVP Reflection & Final Product Planning</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>✅ Task 1: MVP Feedback Integration & Iteration Planning</h2>

    <h3>🔍 Feedback Review & Analysis</h3>

    <p><strong>✨ What were the key strengths of your MVP?</strong><br>
    Some key strengths in my MVP were the core features, which included displaying the 🌦️ weather, 🎵 Spotify, ⏰ time, and a 🗓️ customized calendar.</p>

    <p><strong>🛠️ What areas of improvement did testers or mentors suggest?</strong><br>
    Feedback included:<br>
    - “Bland, black and white is just a little bit dull and boring.” 🎨<br>
    - “It would be awesome to have a real mirror and facial recognition that greets users by name.” 🪞👤</p>

    <p><strong>🚧 Were there any unexpected challenges or issues that emerged?</strong><br>
    Yes — we had several issues trying to implement the camera/mirror feature 🎥. Even with GitHub modules, we couldn’t integrate it smoothly. We're now planning to use a one-way mirror 🔍🪞.</p>

    <p><strong>🧪 How did users interact with your project? Any usability concerns?</strong><br>
    Users customized a calendar 🗓️ and displayed Spotify songs 🎧. A minor issue was the camera showing FPS and RAM info ⚙️📊, which we plan to remove.</p>

    <h3>🛠️ Strategizing Improvements</h3>

    <p><strong>🚀 Top 3 changes to elevate the project:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>🔍 Use one-way reflective glass</li>
      <li>📺 Integrate YouTube videos</li>
      <li>🎨 Improve color and layout</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>🧩 Missing features that would improve quality:</strong><br>
    Facial recognition 🧠 and voice control 🗣️ would enhance user experience.</p>

    <p><strong>⏳ Prioritization based on time and impact:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>🎨 UI redesign first (quick, high impact)</li>
      <li>🪞 One-way mirror setup (core experience)</li>
      <li>📺 YouTube & facial recognition (if time allows)</li>
    </ul>
