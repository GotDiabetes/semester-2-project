            <h2>Week 1-2 (Jan 24 - Feb 7): Software Setup & Understanding the MagicMirror² Framework</h2>
            <h3>Setting Up the Raspberry Pi</h3>
            <p>The first step in building our smart mirror is configuring the Raspberry Pi, which acts as the central processing unit of our project. This involves selecting the appropriate model of Raspberry Pi, installing Raspberry Pi OS, and ensuring that it runs optimally. The Raspberry Pi OS is a lightweight Linux distribution designed for ARM-based processors, making it an ideal choice for embedded systems like smart mirrors.</p>
            <p>After setting up the OS, the next step is to install and configure the MagicMirror² framework. This open-source modular platform enables the integration of various widgets, including time, calendar events, news, and weather updates. We will also ensure that dependencies such as Node.js and npm are correctly installed, as they are crucial for module customization.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Exploring Unique Features for Our Smart Mirror</h3>
            <p>To make our project stand out, we researched various enhancements beyond a basic smart mirror. Our goal is to integrate multiple advanced features for an interactive and personalized experience:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Voice Activation:</strong> We are exploring voice recognition using tools such as Snowboy or Google Assistant API. This will allow users to issue voice commands to control mirror functions hands-free.</li>
                <li><strong>Touch Functionality:</strong> Implementing a touchscreen overlay on the mirror surface will provide an interactive experience, enabling users to navigate through applications, adjust settings, and access information easily.</li>
                <li><strong>Customizable App Selection:</strong> Users will have the ability to choose and personalize which apps they want displayed, such as calendar reminders, traffic updates, and personalized news feeds.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-Time Weather Updates:</strong> We will integrate APIs such as OpenWeatherMap to fetch dynamic weather conditions based on the user’s location, ensuring accurate and up-to-date forecasts.</li>
                <li><strong>Music Projection:</strong> By incorporating Spotify or YouTube Music API, users will be able to play, pause, and control music playback directly through the mirror, providing an enhanced multimedia experience.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Customizing the MagicMirror² Framework</h3>
            <p>The default MagicMirror² setup comes with various built-in modules, but to tailor the interface to our needs, we will make the following customizations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Adjusting the Layout:</strong> We will rearrange module positions for better organization and usability, ensuring that the most important information is displayed prominently.</li>
                <li><strong>Modifying Colors and Fonts:</strong> To improve readability and aesthetic appeal, we will adjust the theme, color scheme, and font sizes to fit our design preferences.</li>
                <li><strong>Enabling or Disabling Modules:</strong> Not all default modules are relevant to our use case, so we will selectively enable or disable them to streamline the user interface.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Researching Additional Features</h3>
            <p>As we refine our software setup, we will delve into research for implementing additional functionalities that enhance user experience. Our focus areas include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Investigating Voice Recognition Libraries:</strong> Comparing open-source libraries such as CMU Sphinx, Mozilla DeepSpeech, and Google Speech-to-Text to determine the most effective solution for our project.</li>
                <li><strong>Exploring Touchscreen Overlays:</strong> Researching capacitive and infrared touchscreen overlays that can be fitted onto a two-way mirror to allow touch input without compromising reflectivity.</li>
                <li><strong>Integrating External APIs:</strong> Evaluating APIs for smart home automation, stock market updates, and fitness tracking to add valuable functionality to our smart mirror.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By the end of these two weeks, we aim to have a functional smart mirror foundation with a roadmap for further enhancements.</p>

            <h3>Benefits of Having Smart Mirrors</h3>
            <p>Smart mirrors have a wide range of applications, from personal convenience to business and healthcare settings. Some key benefits include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personalized Daily Insights:</strong> Users can access real-time weather, news, and calendar updates as part of their morning routine.</li>
                <li><strong>Health Monitoring:</strong> Future implementations can include sensors to track health metrics like weight, BMI, or even detect anomalies in facial expressions related to stress or fatigue.</li>
                <li><strong>Smart Home Integration:</strong> Connected to IoT devices, a smart mirror can serve as a central control panel for smart lighting, thermostat adjustments, and security camera feeds.</li>
                <li><strong>Retail and Business Use:</strong> In commercial settings, smart mirrors can enhance customer experiences by displaying product recommendations, virtual try-ons, or digital advertisements.</li>
            </ul>
