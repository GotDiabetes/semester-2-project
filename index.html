        <section id="development">
            <h2>Development Process</h2>
            <h3>Research and Inspiration</h3>
            <p>Creating my digital webstore began with extensive research into e-commerce platforms, user interfaces, and how to create engaging user experiences. I studied successful online stores to understand their structure, navigation, and product presentation. Platforms like Amazon and Shopify inspired the design of my webstore, with a focus on simplicity and functionality.</p>
            <p>To ensure I had a strong foundation, I learned about the core web technologies—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—and explored their advanced capabilities. I also researched how to handle user data securely and efficiently. Tutorials, online courses, and documentation became my go-to resources, alongside the guidance of my mentor, Jae Park.</p>
            <p>Throughout the development, I tested various design prototypes and sought feedback from peers to refine the visual and functional aspects of the webstore. This iterative process allowed me to continuously improve and adapt my project to user needs.</p>
            <h3>Mentorship</h3>
            <img src="jae.park.jpg" alt="Jae" style="width:150px; height:auto; border-radius:50%; margin-bottom:1rem;">
            <p>My mentor, Jae Park, a Computer Science major at the University of Chicago, played a significant role in guiding me through the project. He provided advice on complex programming challenges, helped me troubleshoot code errors, and introduced me to best practices in web development. His mentorship was crucial in overcoming obstacles, particularly during the database integration phase.</p>
            <h3>Key Milestones</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Milestone 1:</strong> Designed the overall structure of the webstore, creating wireframes and mockups to outline the user experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Milestone 2:</strong> Built the database infrastructure using SQL to securely store user data, including usernames, passwords, and user-specific details.</li>
                <li><strong>Milestone 3:</strong> Implemented a user-friendly interface, enabling visitors to browse products, add items to a cart, and check out seamlessly.</li>
                <li><strong>Milestone 4:</strong> Developed and tested a secure login system to protect user accounts and maintain data privacy.</li>
                <li><strong>Milestone 5:</strong> Continuously optimized the webstore’s performance, ensuring fast load times and mobile responsiveness.</li>
